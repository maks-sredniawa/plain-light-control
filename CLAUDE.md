# Plain Light

An Android app that controls smart lights whose own app is only in Chinese, in the user's own
language. It reads each light's details, keeps its settings per device and controls them all in one
place, with a simple mode (on, off, brightness) plain enough for someone who isn't technical. A light
can also be added to a separate personal dashboard. Free, no ads, no account. Which lights and
protocols it supports is still open: see the plan in `~/repos/local/ideas/plain-light-control.md`.

- **Vocabulary:** [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md) — use these terms in code and UI.
- **Decisions and why:** [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/) — read before changing anything they cover.
- **What's still open:** [`docs/DOD.md`](docs/DOD.md) — the live checklist. **Read this one first.**
- **The arc, in phases:** [`docs/PLAN.md`](docs/PLAN.md) — sequence only; a phase being built gets
  its own `docs/phase-N.md`. Read the phase you're in, not the file.
- **How to work here:** invoke the `lean-loop` skill at the start of every session and keep it
  active. This repo is written before it is built — plans, ADRs and phase documents are long on
  purpose — so the waste is re-reading what is already in the transcript and testing code whose
  shape has not settled.
- **Commits & releasing:** [`docs/RELEASING.md`](docs/RELEASING.md). Commit subjects **must** be
  [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) (`feat:`, `fix:`, `feat!:`, `docs:`, …)
  — a `commit-msg` hook rejects anything else, and release-please derives the version and
  `CHANGELOG.md` from them. `versionName` and `versionCode` are automated; never hand-edit either.

Don't restate ADR reasoning here; link to it. This file is loaded every session and must stay short.

## Working with the person who owns this repo

<Their background, and what to explain rather than assume. For example: "Fluent in
JavaScript/TypeScript, new to Kotlin. Comment code where a Kotlin/Compose idiom has no direct JS
analogue — `Flow` vs promises/observables, `suspend` vs `async`, `remember`/`derivedStateOf` vs
`useMemo`, data class `copy()` vs object spread, sealed classes vs discriminated unions. Explain the
*why*, don't restate the line. Prefer explicit and readable over clever.

The Android **platform** is the other half of the gap and has no JS analogue at all: the manifest as
a declaration the OS reads before any code runs, permission models that differ per API level, process
death, and vendor ROMs overriding documented behaviour. Say when a constraint comes from the platform
rather than from this codebase — that is the difference between "we chose this" and "Android will not
let us do otherwise".">

## Stack

| Choice | Note |
| --- | --- |
| Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Material 3 | Android only, `minSdk` 26 |
| **Navigation 3** (`androidx.navigation3`) | Replaces Navigation Compose 2.x — don't reintroduce the old one |
| Manual DI via `AppContainer`, **not Hilt** | Constructor injection is clearer at this size and easy to migrate later |
| Play Billing (`tip/`), for the tip only | Unlocks nothing; adds `BILLING`, and its merged `INTERNET` is removed — ADR-0007 |
| On-device storage only, in DataStore | No backend and no database. Platform Auto Backup per ADR-0005 |

## House rules

- **An update never loses a user's data.** There is no database: the day a feature adds a table,
  Room and ADR-0001's launch gate come back with it, and so does the parked schema gate in
  [`docs/DOD.md`](docs/DOD.md). Until then a stored key's name and shape are the contract — see
  *Adding a preference*. Verify an upgrade on the phone, not only in a test.
- **A branch merges with every shipped language complete.** Adding an English string does *not*
  redden your build — completeness is a merge gate (`scripts/translation-gate.py`), not a test, so
  copy is translated **once** rather than against draft wording and again after review. Everything
  else about a translation — format arguments, plural categories per CLDR, orphans,
  `translatable="false"` — is `TranslationTest` and holds continuously. Translate from **English
  only**, per [`docs/translator-brief.md`](docs/translator-brief.md).
- **Stores return `Flow`**, screens collect it. Don't hand-roll refresh calls.
- **Enums, not loose strings**, for closed vocabularies. Store enums by **name, never ordinal**, so
  adding a value can't rewrite history.
- **A new preference follows *Adding a preference* in `data/AppPreferences.kt`.** A list the user
  makes is JSON under one key, not a table — [`docs/optional-modules.md`](docs/optional-modules.md),
  *How to decide*.
- One `ViewModel` per screen, UI state as a single immutable data class.
- **Developer-only surface lives in `app/src/debug/`, never in `main/` behind `BuildConfig.DEBUG`.**
  With `isMinifyEnabled = false` a statically-false branch is still compiled into the release AAB —
  a hide, not a strip — and its strings are still inside the translation gate. Each seam is one
  file per variant with a no-op in `src/release/`: `ui/settings/DebugSettings.kt`.
- **Colours come from `MaterialTheme`, never literals.** The palette is generated from four seeds by
  `scripts/gen_scheme.py`; edit the seeds and regenerate, never a single role.
- **Spacing comes from `theme/Spacing.kt`.** Six steps on a 4dp grid; no screen invents a seventh.

## Layout

```
app/src/main/java/<namespace>/
  MainActivity.kt, MainApplication.kt, AppContainer.kt, Navigation.kt, NavigationKeys.kt
               the app shell and Nav3 wiring stay at the package root, not under ui/ — they describe
               how the app hangs together rather than any one screen
  data/        preferences (DataStore)
  theme/       generated palette, type scale, spacing, the night-mode window half
  tip/         the tip through Play Billing, held by AppContainer so a purchase finishes after its
               screen is gone, and the rule for its one ask on the home screen (ADR-0007)
  ui/          Compose screens + ViewModels, one package per area; ui/lights/ is the home screen

app/src/debug/    the developer-only build: Settings' debug section (empty until there is something
                  to seed) and the debug app name
app/src/release/  only the no-op half of each seam, so main/ can call it unconditionally
scripts/          the Python toolchain. project.py is the one place the app's identity lives
art/             mark.py is the identity; both generators derive from it
```

## Versions

Pinned in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`: **AGP 9.0.1, Kotlin 2.3.20, Gradle 9.1.0, Compose BOM
2026.03.01**. `compileSdk`/`targetSdk` 36, `minSdk` 26, JDK 21 toolchain.

`compileSdk` stays at **36**: it is the combination AGP 9.0.1 validates against. Bump deliberately,
with a build to prove it.

## Environment notes

<Fill this in for the machine and phone you actually develop on — it is the section that saves the
most time, and none of it is discoverable from the code. What belongs here:>

- Whether there is an Android Studio, or everything is CLI against a physical phone over USB.
- **More than one device attached: name one.** Gradle and adb both reach every attached device;
  set `ANDROID_SERIAL` (both honour it) or pass `adb -s <serial>`. List each phone here with its
  serial, API level, and whether it is a test phone to drive at will or someone's phone in use.
- **A screenshot of a sleeping phone is its lock screen.** `adb shell svc power stayon usb` keeps it
  awake on USB, and `adb shell wm dismiss-keyguard` gets past a swipe lock.
- **On Xiaomi/HyperOS, MIUI optimisation decides whether adb installs work.** Off, they are
  tap-free; the toggle is at the bottom of Developer options, revealed by tapping "Reset to default
  values" a few times, and an OS update can turn it back on, so check
  `adb shell getprop persist.sys.miui_optimization` reads `false`. On, installs fail
  `INSTALL_FAILED_USER_RESTRICTED`: a split-APK install (`connectedAndroidTest`) prompts on the phone
  and a missed prompt fails the run, and the first install of a brand-new `applicationId` is refused
  outright with no dialog. "Install via USB" lifts that but wants a Mi account and a SIM. With
  neither, install both APKs plain and run the instrumentation directly:
  ```bash
  adb install -r -t app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
  adb install -r -t app/build/outputs/apk/androidTest/debug/app-debug-androidTest.apk
  adb shell am instrument -w <applicationId>.debug.test/androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner
  ```
  and for a brand-new `applicationId`, `adb push` the APK to `/sdcard/Download/` and tap it in the
  file manager.
- **Xiaomi kills background work aggressively.** Scheduled notifications need battery-optimisation
  exemption and **autostart**, and autostart is the load-bearing one: without it the ROM does not
  start the process for a broadcast at all. It has no appop, it is a Settings toggle, and the grant
  **lapses on its own** — re-read it before any run that depends on it. `scripts/device-gate.py`
  reads and sets it.
- **Two device readings look identical to a pass when they are nothing at all.** A database pulled
  without its `-wal` sidecar is **stale** — the app's most recent writes sit in the WAL, so a deleted
  row still reads as present. Pull both and `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` on the host. And
  `cmd jobscheduler run -f -n androidx.work.systemjobscheduler <pkg> <id>` answers *"Could not find
  job N"* on stderr and **exits 0**: `am force-stop` cancels the app's jobs and WorkManager
  re-enqueues under a new id at the next launch, so read the id from `dumpsys jobscheduler` and
  confirm `WM-WorkerWrapper: Starting work for …` in logcat before believing any sweep result.
